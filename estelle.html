                Estelle, it was always really nice when you were at training or even
                led the training. I think it's great that you often take some instructions very literally. I share your sense of humour.
                You always kept my spirit up, but you were also serious and taught me the important stuff :).
                I will definitely miss you at training.
                <br /> Me :)

                Economic super genius! Mission success. We were very lucky to have you in economy for 
                longer than 1 year.
