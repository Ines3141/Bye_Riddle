            Thank you for all the coaching, all the sprints, your spirit. <br />

                I learned to sprint because of Marit. She is a great coach and it was fun playing with her.

                En stor takk, Marit, for alt du har gjort på banen og ikke minst bak scenen.
                Jeg håper vi får muligheter til å spille sammen igjen snart, og at vi holder kontakten.
                Tu nous manques!
                Ta godt vare på deg i mellomtida!

                Thank you for all the work you have put into starting
                and running our beautiful club.
                It really makes my time in Tromsø so much more fun and welcoming! <br /> Isolde

                Marit, Marit. It's not good that you're leaving. Who's going to yell at me to sprint now?
                I really appreciate everything you've done for this club!
                You're a great coach! Motivating, supportive, open to suggestions and encouraging!
                Frisbee won't be the same without you!

                    Who will tell us to sprint faster? No joke, something big will be missing 
                without you.
